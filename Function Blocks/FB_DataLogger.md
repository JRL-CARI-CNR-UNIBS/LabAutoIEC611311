# üì¶ FB_DataLogger ‚Äì TwinCAT Binary Data Logging Function Block

## üß© Overview

`FB_DataLogger` is a PLC function block designed for **logging numeric data** (e.g., time, position, velocity, torque) into a **binary file** during real-time operation in TwinCAT. It abstracts file handling operations like opening, writing, and closing, making it ideal for experiments, simulations, or monitoring tasks in automation and robotics systems.

## üöÄ Example Usage

### Basic Usage in a Cyclic Task

```pascal
fbLogger(
    netId := '',
    sFileName := 'C:\Logs\experiment.bin',
    bOpen := startLogging,
    bWrite := logNow,
    bClose := stopLogging,
    t := systemTime,
    act_pos := position,
    act_vel := velocity,
    act_torque := torque
);
```

- Set `bOpen` TRUE once to open the file.
- Toggle `bWrite` TRUE to log each sample (e.g., once per cycle).
- Set `bClose` TRUE once to close the file when logging is finished.

---

## üìÇ File Format

- Binary format with `ARRAY[1..4] OF LREAL`:
  1. `t` (time)
  2. `act_pos`
  3. `act_vel`
  4. `act_torque`

Each log sample is `4 √ó 8 bytes = 32 bytes`.

---

## üß† Tips

- Use `bWrite` carefully ‚Äî ensure it's triggered once per sample.
- The file is overwritten on each `bOpen`, ensure unique names or post-processing.
- You can analyze the binary data offline using Python, MATLAB, or custom tools.

To load the file 
### üîé In MATLAB
```matlab
% Open file for reading in binary mode
filename = 'C:/Logs/experiment.bin';
fid = fopen(filename, 'rb');

% Check if the file was opened successfully
if fid == -1
    error('Failed to open file.');
end

% Read data: 4 columns, unknown number of rows
data = fread(fid, [4, Inf], 'double');
fclose(fid);

% Transpose for easier handling: rows = samples
data = data';

% Access individual signals
time = data(:,1);
pos  = data(:,2);
vel  = data(:,3);
torque = data(:,4);
```

### üêç In Python

```python
import numpy as np

# Load binary data file (adjust path as needed)
filename = 'C:/Logs/experiment.bin'

# Read binary file: 64-bit floats, 4 values per row
data = np.fromfile(filename, dtype=np.float64).reshape(-1, 4)

# Extract columns
time = data[:, 0]
pos = data[:, 1]
vel = data[:, 2]
torque = data[:, 3]
```
